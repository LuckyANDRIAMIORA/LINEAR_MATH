# 🧠 linear_math

A lightweight C library for linear algebra — written from scratch, for fun and for the love of learning.

## ⚙️ What is this?

`linear_math` is a personal project to implement core linear algebra operations in C. No shortcuts — just raw C, pointers, and math.

## ✨ Features (so far)

- Vector creation & destruction  
- Set/Get vector elements  
- Scalar multiplication  
- Vector addition  
- Vector subtraction  
- Dot product  
- Magnitude calculation  
- Vector normalization  
- Print vectors (because seeing the math helps)  

More coming as I explore deeper into the math.

## 🧪 Build & Run
